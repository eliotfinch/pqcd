# qcd_likelihood

Investigations into the pQCD constraints proposed in [Komoltsev & Kurkela 2022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05350).

The `qcd_likelihood.py` file contains both the "maximised" likelihood (as used in [Gorda et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11877)) and "marginalised" likelihood (as used in [Komoltsev et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14127)).

The file `collated_np_all_post.csv` is a copy of the file found at 

`ldas-grid:/home/isaac.legred/PTAnalysis/Analysis`, 

and is a summary of the EOS draws found at 

`ldas-grid:/home/philippe.landry/nseos/eos/gp/mrgagn`.
