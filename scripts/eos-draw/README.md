### gp1

Originally set 12.

### gp2

Originally set 25. This process is created within the `custom\_gp.ipynb` notebook. Means are pQCD-consistent draws from GP1 (I have lost the code that generates the `means.dat` file, but it is simply a random sample of 1000 draws from GP1. Hyperparameters for the kernel are mostly generated within the `custom\_gp.ipynb`, with the exception of hyperparameters for the square exponential kernel, which are created within `inspect\_hyperparameters.ipynb`.
