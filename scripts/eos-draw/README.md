### gp1

Originally set 12.

### gp2

Originally set 25. This process is created within the `custom_gp.ipynb` notebook. Means are pQCD-consistent draws from GP1 (`means.dat`, which consists of a random sample of 1000 pQCD-consistent draws from GP1, was created in `modify_tabulated_eos.ipynb`). Hyperparameters for the kernel are mostly generated within the `custom_gp.ipynb`, with the exception of hyperparameters for the square exponential kernel, which are created within `inspect_hyperparameters.ipynb`.
