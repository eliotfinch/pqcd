Same means as set 21, but now with custom kernels - the idea being we have a GP which we avoid conditioning for, and we have a kernel which is simply kSE*scaling. Set 21 was a bit more complicated because the kernels were created by conditioning on a stitch at high pressure, and then multiplying by a scaling at low pressure (so we have a situation where the kernel has been conditioned, but the means haven't)
